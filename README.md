### Overview
**Google Books Search**  is a full-stack MERN application that allows users to search for books via the Google Books API.  This app integrates my creativity in designing an inviting UI with my fullstack technical skills.  

### Features
* The main (landing) page is the ```Search```page.  Here, users can search for books via the Google Books API.  The searched book titles are rendered to the client where the User has the option to "View" a book, bringing them to the Google Books page, or "Saving" a book, which saves to the app's database.

* The ```Saved``` page stores and displays all books saved by the user. Here, the user has an option to "View" book details via the Google Books site, or to remove ("Delete") the book from saved books list.
